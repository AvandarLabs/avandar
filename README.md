## Local development

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js
2. Yarn
3. Docker Desktop
4. Supabase CLI

### Set up

1. Clone this repo

2. Initiate a local instance of Supabase (you need to have installed Supabase CLI for this)

```bash
supabase start
```

You should be able to access your local Supabase Studio at a URL provided
in the output (most likely `http://localhost:54323`)

3. Set up your environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.development
```

And then fill in the necessary environment variables. For the Supabase
variables, you should be able to get that info from the output of having
started Supabase locally in the prior steps.

4. Set up your local database

```bash
yarn db:reset
```

This will reset your Supabase database, apply all local migrations from
the `supabase/migrations` directory, and then add the seed data from
`seed/SeedConfig.ts`

5. Start the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Creating new CRUD models

### 1. DB schema changes

1. Create a SQL DB schema in `supabase/schemas`
2. Generate a new migration with `yarn db:new-migration your_migration_name`
3. Review that the generated migration makes sense and does what you need to.
4. Apply the new migration with `yarn db:apply-migrations`

### 2. Set up the TypeScript models

1. Generate the new types with `yarn db:gen-types`
2. Run `yarn new:model YourModel your_db_table_name` to create your new model with CRUD variants.

This will create a new directory in `src/models/[YourModel]/` with the following files:

- `types.ts`: All TypeScript types for this model. Only types should exist here, no actual runtime-executable code.
- `parsers.ts`: All Zod schemas for this model. This file also includes Type-level tests to ensure the Zod schemas are consistent with the model types from the `types.ts` file.
- `[YourModel]Client.ts`: API client for this model.

3. Update your model types in the `types.ts`. Make sure your frontend model's `Read`, `Insert`, and `Update` variants are correctly specified.

- For `Insert`, our convention is to wrap the `Read` variant in `SetOptional<Required<ModelRead>, requiredFields>`. Meaning, we make the `Read` variant fully required, and then we specify the optional fields.
- If your `Read` variant has a discriminated union, you will need sub-types for each part of the union, and then reference them in the `Insert` and `Update` variants. See [EntityFieldConfig.types.ts](src/models/EntityConfig/EntityFieldConfig/EntityFieldConfig.types.ts) for an example. This is because if you apply `Partial<>` or `SetRequired<>` to the full object, TypeScript loses the discriminated union and treats it as a regular union. Splitting up the union into types and applying `Partial<>` or `SetRequired<>` to each sub-type allows us to maintain the discriminated union.

4. Set up the Zod schema parsers in `parsers.ts`.

- Ensure the `DBRead`, `DBInsert`, and `DBUpdate` schemas match the model's database table in `src/types/database.types.ts`.
  - For the `DBInsertSchema` our convention is to call `DBReadSchema.required().partial({ fields })`. Meaning, we make the `DBReadSchema` fully required, and then we specify which fields are optional.
- Ensure the frontend model's `ModelRead`, `ModelInsert`, and `ModelUpdate` schemas match the types in `types.ts`.
  - For the `ModelInsertSchema` our convention is to call `ModelReadSchema.required().partial({ fields })`. Meaning, we make the `ModelReadSchema` fully required, and then we specify which fields are optional.
- Ensure there are no TypeScript errors being thrown in the `makeParserRegistry` line or in the type-level tests at the end of the file.

5. Verify there are no TypeScript errors in `[YourModel]Client.ts`.
