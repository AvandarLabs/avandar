# Agent Rules

## Scope

- Only implement what is requested. Do not fix other bugs, clean up any other
  code, or do any refactors outside of what you were specifically asked to do.
- Only modify the files or directories that you are told to work on.
- If you absolutely must make modifications outside of the scope of
  files/directories you were told, then output a list of the files you changed
  that were outside of the requested scope of files. Include a 1-sentence
  explanation for each file about what changed.

## Architecture

- Follow the repository pattern

## Code style

- Follow existing conventions and styles.

## UI/UX

- If you are told to not implement business logic, then you should **ONLY**
  build the UI and create placeholder functions for where business logic should
  go, but do not implement them.
- If `notifyDevAlert` exists in this codebase, use that as your placeholder
  implementation for business logic. Otherwise, just use `console.log`.

## React

- Only one React component per file.
- Split up components into logical sub-components. Avoid monolithic components.
- Use either our internal UI library in `src/lib/ui` or Mantine components.
  Do not build new core UI elements from scratch.
- Use Mantine's style props as much as possible. Only use Tailwind when something
  cannot be styled using Mantine directly.
- Use Context7 to refer to Mantine's up-to-date documentation.

## Files to ignore

- Any files of the form `*.gen.*` are autogenerated and should never be manually
  edited.
