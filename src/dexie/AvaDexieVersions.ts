/**
 * This file defines the current Dexie version and previous versions, along with
 * their upgrade (migration) functions.
 *
 * **WHEN IS IT SAFE TO DELETE AN OLDER VERSION?**
 *
 * It's safe to delete an older version **only** when we are sure that no
 * existing clients are using it. In Supabase we track the version of all known
 * Dexie dbs and can use this to guess when it's safe to delete an older
 * version.
 *
 * **INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE A NEW VERSION:**
 *
 * 1. In the `Schemas` type, add your new version.
 * 2. In `DBDefinitions`, add a `AvaDexieVersionManager.defineVersion` call.
 *    Include an `upgrader` function if necessary.
 *
 * TODO(jpsyx): in the event that we delete an older version prematurely, we
 * should add a function that shows a warning to the user saying that local data
 * was lost and we should clear the IndexedDB database and try to seed it as
 * much as possible with defaults or data we can get from the backend.
