 * that we can enforce that the `Insert` type always be equal to the
 * `Read` type, which is why we do not expect a separate `Insert`
 * type to be supplied here.
 *
 * This means that the frontend must always supply all necessary types,
 * such as UUIDs, when inserting models into the database, but this is
 * an okay tradeoff in order to have to manage one less type. It also
 * makes model insertion more explicit and no need to rely on database
 * behavior to fill in any default values.
